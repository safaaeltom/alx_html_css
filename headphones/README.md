Project Overview

This project involves creating a fully functional and visually accurate web page from scratch using HTML and CSS, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks. The goal is to implement a web page that mirrors the designer file provided in Figma while applying best practices in accessibility, responsiveness, and clean code.

This task allows full creative freedom in implementation, challenging developers to showcase their understanding of web fundamentals and attention to detail.

Features Implemented

Accessibility: Semantic HTML structure, meaningful alt texts, and focusable interactive elements for better accessibility.

Custom CSS Styling: Utilized pure CSS, including Flexbox and Grid, to achieve the desired layout and styling.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Tested across multiple browsers for consistent rendering.
